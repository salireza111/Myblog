<h2>Just before entering the quarter-century club and turning 25 ðŸ¥³, a <a href="http://micrograph.studio/">friend</a> surprised me with an awesome gift: 
<br>
&emsp;A 3D-printed version of RNR, a model thatâ€™s 5*10<sup>7</sup> times bigger (1nm:5cm)! </h2>

#### P.S. Iâ€™ve never felt or seen anything like this beforeâ€”discovering how incredible proteins are and realizing the tiny scale of life we rely on is mind-blowing.

#### P.S.2 We donâ€™t often get the chance to grasp the huge magnificationsâ€”millions of timesâ€”needed just to be able to touch something this small. Now all those numbers about microscopy finally make sense in a whole new way. 
#### P.S.3  Feeling it with my eyes closed is amazing tooâ€”it makes me think of an AFM :)
