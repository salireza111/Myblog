For the last holidays I dove back into Mindustry. I‚Äôd played solo before, but this time four of us teamed up over a local session‚Äîand wow, it was a blast. It still amazes me how they pack so much detail and smooth play into a 70 MB game.

#### Free to play? ‚úîÔ∏è

Back at work I wanted to bring our four-day campaign onto my own PC. That meant reinstalling the exact build we‚Äôd used, then copying the saves. With my snail internet (see earlier posts) that sounded painful. Then I remembered how easily the game connected over LAN‚Äîwhy not move the files the same way?

#### Manual sharing? Nope.
#### Search around for some tools? Also Nope.

So I put together a quick transfer app in PyQt. A few prompts to GPT later and it felt good enough to release. Say hello to FileDrop, a small, cross-platform file-sharing toolkit.
While building it I tacked on a couple of bonuses: sending short notes (handy for mirroring GPT prompts between two machines) and a one-click option to pull files from an SSH server via SCP‚Äîto finally scratching that old itch.
