# The Question!

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
After the first-round results were announced, we met with (@Kave_nasr) to tackle the following question: Could we establish a single metricâ€”or a combination of metricsâ€”that reliably indicates binding confidence among the top-ranked candidates?
Drawing on data from the IL-7a case study and all 201 sequences from the first round, we predicted each structure, took the top-ranked (rank 1) model, and then applied the Rosetta Score function and interface-analyzer (as used by Vasquez and Kuhlman) to seek meaningful correlations. (All structures underwent the fast-relax protocol, in parallel with AF2, to gain some computational advantages over AF2 relaxation.)
Below are a few of the plots exploring an assumed correlation between iPAE and X, where X includes:

â€¢	Hbond energy

â€¢	Interface SASA

â€¢	Number of Interface Residues

â€¢	Complexed Energy

â€¢	Side_Score

â€¢	Hydrophobic Interactions

â€¢	Electrostatic_Score

â€¢	Fold_Tree

â€¢	Rotamers_Score

### Discussion
<div style="text-align: justify"> 

For now, we plan to include other bakersâ€™ work from RFDiffusion and Round 2 of Adaptyv bio, as it helps clarify noise and, importantly, addresses two main points: first, reducing the bias from the large number of successful proteins reported in the RFDiffusion paper, and second, classifying binders by the model or other shared criteria.

For example, if we look at VÃ¡zquezâ€™s work and the recommended filters (ddG < -40 & pAE <10), it does help screen out cases that donâ€™t meet those conditions. However, there are two issues:
</div>

â€¢ Although it effectively filters non-binders, it does not reliably confirm binding confidence.

â€¢ For semi-natural binders disqualified in Round 1, these filters did not align with the results.

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Itâ€™s also worth noting that we used highly selective IL-7a data. We are now calculating Round 2 metrics and incorporating more RFDiffusion data to achieve better classification.
